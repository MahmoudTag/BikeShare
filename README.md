# Bikeshare Data Exploration Project

## Project Overview
This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) of bikeshare trip data to identify patterns and trends in usage. The analysis focuses on trip duration, user demographics, and peak usage times to uncover insights valuable for city planning and operational optimization.

## Key Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzed bikeshare data to identify usage patterns by day, time, and user demographics.
- **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Handled missing values and converted data types for meaningful analysis.
- **Data Aggregation**: Used Python libraries to group and analyze data efficiently.
- **Visualizations**: Created visual representations of trends using Matplotlib and Seaborn to provide a clear understanding of findings.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Data Preparation**: Data cleaning and handling missing values

## Key Visuals
- Bar charts for trip frequency
- Histograms for trip durations
- Peak usage time plots
