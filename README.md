In this project, bikeshare trip data was analyzed to explore usage patterns by day, time, and user demographics. The work involved data cleaning, handling missing values, and converting data types to prepare the dataset for analysis. Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy were used for data aggregation, and visualizations were created using Matplotlib and Seaborn to display trends and comparisons.
